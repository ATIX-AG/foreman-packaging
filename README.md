deb packaging branches
======================

The deb/\* branches contain the Debian packaging files for Foreman and it's
dependencies. The repo mirrors [Foreman Core](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman),
i.e. deb/develop is for packaging branch 'develop', deb/1.3 is for packaging release
1.3 and so on

Contributing
============

It's generally best to contribute to 'deb/develop' unless something is specifically
broken for an older release. Please fork and send a PR.
